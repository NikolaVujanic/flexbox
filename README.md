### next steps


- styling of container controls
- add a resize on command button
- overall styling (colors really);
- integrate templates into tour
- make possible other commands from tour
- do some QA -- find bugs that occur when switching from row/column adding new items to different things... probably will be solved by making sure things are nulled properly upon changes being made...
