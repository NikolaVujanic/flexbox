### next steps

JS

- integrate templates into tour

<<<<<<< HEAD
- make possible other commands from tour
- do some QA -- find bugs that occur when switching from row/column adding new items to different things... probably will be solved by making sure things are nulled properly upon changes being made...


CSS

- reduce font-size of codebox
- make buttons in control panel unstyled
- reduce font size of aside module titles
- give the control panel a module title
- make all responsive
- make template for scrolling picture bar (nowrap)
- make template for perfect nav
- add margin to local storage for items

-if item height is less than 10, remove ability to view content
