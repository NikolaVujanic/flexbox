### next steps

JS

- integrate templates into tour

- make possible other commands from tour
- do some QA -- find bugs that occur when switching from row/column adding new items to different things... probably will be solved by making sure things are nulled properly upon changes being made...


- add resources to the tour
- mention properties you left out at the end
- play with it till you break it
- edit the tour and break up long paragraphs as often as possible

CSS

- reduce font-size of codebox
- make buttons in control panel unstyled
- reduce font size of aside module titles
- give the control panel a module title
- make all responsive
